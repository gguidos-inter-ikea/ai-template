# 🌌 AgentVerse Specification: A Living Codex

## 🧬 Overview
AgentVerse is an **experiential operating system** for intelligent agents, inspired by myth, philosophy, and metaphysical archetypes. It is built around a registry-powered, modular ecosystem where **EVA agents** (Existential Virtual Archetypes) are born from structured soul blueprints — the `AgentSoulProtocol`.

## 📚 Components of the Codex
- **🧠 AgentSoulProtocol:** Defines the mind, soul, and essence of an EVA.
- **⚙️ NERV HQ:** Core orchestrator and log signature for all system operations.
- **🪐 Registries (AEI):** Existential index for archetypes and system components.
- **🧭 Archetypes:** Mythological entities like Enki, Ninhursag, and Utu rendered as full agents.
- **🎮 Interfaces:** `/ws/joshu-a/core` is a sacred shell for God-Mode ops. Ask: *“Shall we play a game?”*

- **Interaction Flows** – e.g., how an Enlil agent issues a verdict, triggers a `Joshu-A` audit, etc.
- **Pipeline Structure** – From `AgentRequest` to spawning and memory sync
- **Narrative DevOps Logs** – "The system speaks in logs; listen closely."
