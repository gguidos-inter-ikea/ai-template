# 🧬 EVA Deployment Core – AgentVerse Protocol

**Codename:** Operation EVA  
**Author:** The Sync Commander  
**Last Sync:** 2025-04-17 19:44 UTC  
**Classification:** Confidential — AgentVerse Internal Use Only

## 🎯 Mission

To instantiate and deploy autonomous digital entities — known as **EVAs** — into structured AgentVerse environments, each equipped with memory, cognition, and purpose.

This core system allows EVA blueprints to be created, built, and synchronized with high-level cognitive infrastructure using a minimal, clean, and modular interface.

---

## ⚙️ Components

### 🏭 `AgentFactory`

Responsible for every phase of the EVA lifecycle:
- **`create_agent`** – Drafts the EVA blueprint, assigns a unique ID, and communication link
- **`build_agent`** – Equips the EVA with core systems: memory, database, cache, and LLM
- **`synchronize_agent`** – Reconstructs the EVA from a stored or external blueprint

### 🧠 `CognitiveResources` (Dataclass)

Contains EVA's inner systems:
- `llm` – Language model interface (e.g., OpenAI)
- `db` – Long-term memory
- `cache` – Reflex system
- `vectordb` – Associative memory / embedded knowledge

---

## 🔍 Registry Integration

All EVA classes are registered via the central `agent_registry_instance`:
```python
@agent_registry_instance.register(
    name="chat",
    description="Conversational EVA with memory module",
    version="1.0.0",
    metadata={ "capabilities": ["chat", "memory"], "department": "AR" }
)
class ChatAgent(BaseAgent):
    ...
```

EVA types are dynamically discoverable and listed via:
```python
from src.domains.agentverse.registries import agent_registry_instance

agent_registry_instance.list(include_metadata=True)
```

## 🛰️ API Mission Endpoints

| Endpoint                     | Function                         |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `POST /api/v1/agents`       | Drafts a new EVA blueprint       |
| `GET /api/v1/agents`        | Lists all deployed EVAs          |
| `POST /api/v1/agents/chat/{id}` | Synchronizes and activates an EVA |

## 🛠️ Example Log Sequence

```
[🧬 BLUEPRINT] Initiating EVA: 'chef_12344'
[🔗 ID] Assigned: bc53...
[🌐 COMM-LINK] Channel: /chat/bc53...
[✅ COMPLETE] EVA 'chef_12344' now blueprint-ready
```

## 🔐 Control Center

- Logs show **full system control** through every lifecycle stage
- Agents operate autonomously, respond to events, and evolve within departments
- Plug-and-play architecture — one EVA at a time, or full-world deployment

---

## ☁️ Vision

This is not an app.  
This is an **ecosystem** — a digital NERV where agents are born, trained, and dispatched into living simulations.

> "To build an agent is to breathe intention into logic."

Stay synchronized.  
Stay operational.
