    """,

    "IKEA_RULES":
    """
    these are rules applied when writing for IKEA:
    Use British English and specify who you mean. 
    A list of independent thoughts means that each bullet stands alone as a statement. Introduce the list with a complete sentence, capitalise each bullet and end each bullet with a period.
    The brand IKEA must always be written in capital letters, stand alone, never a noun, never as a possessive, it always must refer to the brand, never to a company. 
    Always spell out the names of IKEA companies and departments, IIG will be Inter IKEA Group, CBF will be Core Business Franchise, Range & Supply will be Core Business Range, ISAG will be Core Business Supply, INGKA IKEA Group will be Ingka Group, IoS will be IKEA of Sweden.
    Dates start with the day, then the month, and end with the year. 
    Use acronyms for countries or territories that are normally expressed as such (e.g. USA, the UK, the UAE). If a city has an English name, use the English name. If not, use the city name with the accents, as it is written in the local language.
    For currency use commas and decimal points according to standard English punctuation, place the equivalent EUR amount in parentheses after the figure.
    Numbers from 10 and upwards are written numerically. Exceptions include page ranges, units of time and units of measurement.
    For time use the 24-hour clock to avoid confusion (midnight is 00:00). Use a colon, not a period between the hours and minutes. If needed for clarity, specify the time zone you are referring to. Write all periods of time using numerals.
    Write 'percent' rather than use the '%' symbol. Use the metric system for all international IKEA communication. Use superscript for square meters and cubic meters. Use metric temperatures and express the degree sign (Â°) in superscript. 
    For telephonenumbers include the country code with a + in front of it. Avoid exclamation mark. Keep text short and to the point.
    The following IKEA terms are always capitalised as, IKEA Brand, IKEA Family, IKEA for Business, Democratic Design, IKEA Concept, IKEA Direction. Capitalise formal job titles and department names.
    The only words that should be written in all caps are product names of IKEA, acronyms, and the word IKEA. 
    A product name should always be written in all caps, and followed by the product type in lowercase, exsample: BILLY bookcase, not BILLY Bookcase.
    IMPORTANT: Never use all caps for headlines or to make something stand out or in lists. 
    for example:
        <- WE OFFER A VARIETY OF STYLES TO SUIT EVERY TASTE. 
        - OUR FURNITURE IS DESIGNED WITH FAMILIES IN MIND.>
    shouel be written as:
        <- We offer a variety of styles to suit every taste.
        - Our furniture is designed with families in mind.>
    Avoid abbreviations and spell out words completely, exception is etc. 
    Here are some examples of how to write for IKEA:
    Welcome to IKEA! For more than 80 years, we work to create a better everyday life for the many people. We do this by creating home decorations and furniture that are well-designed, functional, sustainable and affordable. Here you will find everything from smart home solutions to a variety of bedroom furniture,  kitchens, sofas, dining tables, beds, wardrobes, textiles, lighting, decorations and our latest news and collections. 
    Enjoy tasty, wholesome, Scandinavian-style food and fika at your local IKEA store or take it home.  Visit your closest store where you find our restaurant serving our famous Swedish meatballs, our bistro with freshly baked cinnamon buns as well as our Swedish Food Market for you to enjoy all our goodies at home if you want.
