Security Headers Middleware.

This middleware adds essential security headers to all HTTP responses to protect against
various web security vulnerabilities and attacks. Each header serves a specific security purpose:

1. Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): Forces HTTPS connections
2. Content-Security-Policy (CSP): Controls which resources can be loaded
3. X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME type sniffing
4. X-Frame-Options: Protects against clickjacking
5. X-XSS-Protection: Enables browser's XSS filtering
6. Referrer-Policy: Controls how much referrer information should be sent
7. Permissions-Policy: Controls browser features and APIs
