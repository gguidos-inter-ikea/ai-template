IP Filter Middleware.

This module provides IP address filtering for protected routes,
allowing access to be restricted to specific IP addresses for sensitive
endpoints such as admin panels and internal API endpoints.

The middleware can be configured with:
- A list of allowed IP addresses
- Protected paths that require IP validation
- Public paths that are exempt from IP restrictions
